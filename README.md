## Overview

Each subdirectory in this repository demonstrates a focused aspect of Spring Boot development ranging from database integrations, caching, messaging, and multi-tenancy to advanced topics like Chaos Engineering and observability.

**Key Features**:
1. **Wide Range of Integrations**: Explore different databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Oracle), caching with Redis, and advanced topics like multi-tenancy.
2. **Observability & Monitoring**: Many samples include Prometheus, Grafana, or Kibana. They demonstrate setting up and analyzing application performance in real-time.
3. **Scalability & Resilience Patterns**: Investigate Chaos Monkey for injecting controlled failures, or look at multi-database solutions for horizontal scaling.
